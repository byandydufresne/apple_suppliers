# Apple Suppliers

Apple released a list of all of its suppliers, as a PDF file.

To make it more accessible and easier to digest for humans, I extracted the data from PDF, geolocated all the supplier plants and put them on the map.

### Final map
An interactive map with all the supplier locations is at the bottom of [this page](https://ssobczak.github.io/apple_suppliers/analyze_suppliers.html).

All the notebooks are rendered as webpages and listed on [the Github Pages for this repo](https://ssobczak.github.io/apple_suppliers/).

### Data
Source PDF and a CSV with all the plants with their geolocation are in [data dir](https://github.com/ssobczak/apple_suppliers/tree/master/data).
